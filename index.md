  <p><a><strong>Hello,</strong></a></p>
  <p>Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a biomedical engineer searching for a Phd program having finished my Master's degree in the same field at the University of Zaragoza (Spain). I did my final proyect about the Da Vinci Robot. I used different programs to make it happen. I did sucessfully design the robot and also programand its movement. I am passionate about tissue engineering, medical robots, organoids, prosthesis and implant design, and rehabilitation applications. I am hard working and i keep persevearing in a task till i get it done.</p>

<div class="home-section about-me">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the European University of Madrid and a Master's degree from the same field from University of Zaragoza. My research interests include scaffolds, tissue-implant interface, prosthesis, and many more. I have a strong background in both theoretical knowledge and practical applications in biomedical engineering. My background has expanded even more thanks to my Master's degree that has given me autonomy in looking for solutions to medical robotic problems.</p>
