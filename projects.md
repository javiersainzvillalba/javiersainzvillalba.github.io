      <p>Minimally invasive surgery</p>
      <p>Surgical robots perform surgeries that are minimally invasive surgeries. This type of surgery has the following procedure:</p>
      <p>- The doctors make small incisions in the abdomen of the pacient between 0.5cm to 1cm </p>
      <p>- Co2 is introduced in the abdominal cavity so the surgeons see well the area of operation.</p>
      <p>- Lastly the doctors place the arm tools and the laparoscope in the small incisions made at the beginnig of the procedure</p>

      <p>Surgical robots</p>
      <p>There are a lot of different surgical robots but few are used in significant numbers. Nonetheless the ones that aren't used as much have also great features. These are some examples:</p>
      <p>- Senhance robot: it has haptic retroalimentation so the surgeon feels the presure of the typ of the arm tool and offers the posibility of reusable tools</p>
      <p>- Hugo Ras: It has data analysis in real time.</p>
      <p>- The Da Vinci robot, the one this project is based on, is the one that is most used and known.</p>

      <p>The project wanted to replicate the behaviour of the Da Vinci robot (2009). For that purpouse:</p>
      <p>- The 3D model of the Da Vinci robot is developed in Fusion 360.</p>
      <p>- In this project CoppeliaSim is used as a physics simulator.</p>
      <p>- I create protype trayectories and basic scenario so all the features can be tested.</p>
      <p>- I programmed the movement and the joystick using Python and the robotics-toolbox lybrary.</p>
